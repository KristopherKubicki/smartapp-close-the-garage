# Close the Garage
This is a very simple SmartApp that simply closes a door if no motion has been detected for a while. 

The SmartApp relies on motion states rather than schedule() calls, which makes it a lot more robust than other solutions I've seen. 

It probably goes without saying, but this SmartApp can cause a lot of damage if you have not taken safety precautions.  Make sure your safety sensors are working properly before installing this application. Any damage caused by this code is solely your responsibility. y.
